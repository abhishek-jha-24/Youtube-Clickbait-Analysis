Watford fc need to comment, Fair
Hi, Fair
Simon disguises just body shape and stance so well that it’s close to impossible to know where the ball is going until it’s already 1/3 the way there!, Fair
You're better than Aubameyang mate., Fair
Better than Rashford's penalty tho..., Fair
Simon scored a penalty against Ben. Aubameyang couldn't. So Simon is better than aubameyang, Fair

Next up.. Extracting the anesthetic from anusol suppositories, Fair
"based on almost nothing" is gonna be my senior quote, Fair
basically the whole video for people who are watching this for school snowing outside river flowing? flowing water higher kinetic energy because moving no kinetic energy is frozen high kinetic energy=hot low kinetic energy=cold no kinetic energy= frozen need nucleation point=start forming crystal by hitting or pouring on ice moving water has kinetic energy so no freezing unless very cold water does not become ice ice slowly takes over the water (best wording i can do), Fair
I would give it a shot with breaking down a cubic foot of wood to see how much sugar can be made I'd watch it., Fair
Nice but can you unburn paper? 🤔, Fair

Mistakes cost the Seminoles the game: * 3 interceptions * bad hut pass to the quarterback in the 4th forcing a tying field goal * A ball drop by the quarterback to force a field goal * Missed 37 yrd field goal in OT Great game. It felt like a championship game., Fair

I’m so thankful for your sponsored ad. I’ve been wanting to lose weight for a while now and I think this app will be the app I need thank you so much!, Fair
I signed & shared your Petition! I think you'd make a fun host!, Fair
M&M Maximum soft inside Maximum hard outside, Fair
Hold on. You tried to measure the candy shell with a ruler? Please do yourself a favor and grab an electronic caliper. You can find plenty decent ones for like $20 or less and they will change your life!, Fair
m&m's : Chocolate melts in your hand in 4 minutes and also dissolves in your sweat. ;), Fair
Actually I've never heard the M&Ms's slogan once in my life., Fair
I was told M&Ms were made for astronauts. Sounds like NASA has been lying to kids., Fair
The truth come out: does M&Ms is melt?, Fair
mini m&ms are better than regular m&ms, Fair
They could change to "melt in your mouth not ON your hand", Fair
mat why are u trying to melt slim shady 😳, Fair
Me didn't know that MnM had a chach fraze, Fair
The guy voicing the human torch at the beginning sounded like the guy narrating in the "bright side" yt channel, Fair
i like melted m n' ns, Fair
The milk chocolate slogan kind of makes sense many times slogans and quotes go through a game of telephone and often get changed. That's why some people believe in the Mandela Effect what's happening is that phrases just sort of get messed up over time from people misquoting., Fair
Idea For Christmas: So in Elf buddy says he eats nothing but candy syrup and among other sweets. So if he’s a full grown adult living on sweets how did he survive, Fair
You should see if the chocolate in M&M’s hardens back up. And that might be the point of military shipment. It melts but stays in cased in the sugar shell to later be hardened after shipment. As if nothing happened in the bag unlike their chocolate bar counterparts., Fair
Who the creep on the left lmao what a weirdo, Fair
Bryan saying he wants to kick their fucking heads in that was the whole thing for me, Fair
Miz called... Who's the coward now??, Fair
Tony is like Thanos with all the Stones so happy for him to live his dream. Go Bryan., Fair
Bryan Danielson's matches since he came to AEW have all been so great now. He really makes everything he does to the smallest detail just make sense and look amazing., Fair
We could finally see CM Punk vs Bryan Danielson, Fair
Sports entertainment vs. Pro wrestling??? , Fair
Tony Khan is more passion and genuine for what the fans want than Eric Bichoff and Vince McMahon, Fair
Did everyone read about how incredbiel WWE is from Daniel Bryan's release today?, Fair
I'm actually starting to be a big fan of AEW. Its growing exponentially. I think Tony is make a big difference and its something the industry needed. I like to see the shift of ex WWE starting to be more excited to wrestle agaim, Fair
For the love of God...Bryan bring the Final Countdown intro back!!!!, Fair
They were asking $50 000 per play. Basically "we don't want our music on that.", Fair
gotta say Danielson's music sucks ATM Tony already shelled out money for Tarzan Boy Wild Thing and Cult of Personality... what's the harm in licensing The Final Countdown?, Fair
 Chris Bradley if it's Danielson's own choice then fine I just thought it was weird for Tony to start getting stingey with his dad's money, Fair
even if they were willing to shell out alot of money for it i odnt think Bryan would let them seeing his life outside of WWE he doesnt spend alot of money and doesnt want people spending alot of money on him, Fair
They want $50 000 per play. Europe hates their own song., Fair
Tony khan is the biggest mark off all, Fair
Good. I like someone who likes wrestling in charge., Fair
It’s crazy to see Conor McGregor speak calmly 😮, Fair
I like daniel bryan better, Fair
My love for Bryan aside the wonder in Tony’s eyes as he sits in for these is SOMETHING to behold., Fair
Just to think how sad it was when Bryan was injured in 2014 2015 and having to step away and retire when he was so beloved. And here he is now continuing his dream in the hottest most exciting company he could be. How can you not root for him?, Fair
Tony Khan be off his head. Look at those dilated pupils and weird shakey facial expressions., Fair
Bryan Danielson.....probably will return to WWE for 1 last run at some point. Adam Cole....may well if the opportunity and time is right CM Punk....no chance he will ever return IMO., Fair
very fast. So AEW better make the most of this current love fest and fast., Fair
If you cared about Darby for real you would have put Darby over punk, Fair

His face on the end looked pretty cursed lol, Fair

Teacher: “Did you just say werewolf?” Me: werewolf….. werewolf……, Fair
Gods speed werewolf hunter, Fair
Me theory: this is just a made up story. The actual story is a story that she told on her channel. It goes something like this. A student was sleeping a lot in class so the teacher asked "is everything okay with your sleep life at home ". Student said "Yes. I'm just a little tired from sleeping on the floor. "The teacher asked "why are you sleeping on the floor? " The student said that it was because his mattress had blood stains on it. It was from his abusive father who had hurt his mother on his bed leaving blood stains. And worst of all it all happened while the child was watching. The teacher decided to buy a new mattress for the student. She had it sent to his house., Fair
I can't stand when teachers think sleeping on the floor is danger 🤦🏾‍♀️, Fair
 Dial "Hello?" "Yeah is this CPS?", Fair
😂😂😂, Fair
oh my what would you even do about that, Fair
There's either you're full of it or there's some serious drug abuse Happening Here, Fair

Y'all a bunch of weirdos on here fr 🤢, Fair
Tf is this cringe shit man. Can someone explain to me why out of all the CLB reaction videos this one has 3x as many views as the next highest one? Bruh weird and corny asl and he be reading into shit way too much. It's just music man, Fair
Then go watch someone else the fuck? Clearly my style of content ain't for you nigga, Fair
At first I thought the cover art was dumb and lazy but then realized it was kind of ironically well thought out. Essentially declairing the album as Iconic (whether you think so/realize yet or not) by litering it with Icons (emojis) which seems like a troll move. At this point Drake is so hyper successful he can afford to have that type of trolling fun with his official cover art. A lot of what Drake does goes over peoples heads and I think this could be more of a jab at those people. But then they also never realize that's how he stays so successful. , Fair
Yeeee, Fair
Bro trying SO HARD to not enjoy it, Fair
Not bad but repetitive, Fair
fair trade could’ve been drake on his own tbh that mf heat 🤷🏾, Fair
I feel like most of the songs were good but felt like they were trying to copy a sound. Love all sounded like Pound cake Fountains sounds like a bad copy of one dance no friends in the industry sounds like a scorpion song knife talk sounds like a standard 21 savage song that drake is trying to act like he's hard. idk I still think the album is solid tho, Fair
Are we not going to talk about how much he bullies FKA Twigs, Fair
Donda is just purely better…like I really don’t have a horse in this race I appreciate both but I mean this is insane to compare. I saved like 4 things on this thing and don’t ever come back to em, Fair
Probably unfair to you because I watched a few reactions already but this was pretty bad., Fair
like your content for the most part but i really think you re-think your energy for your next Drake reaction i notice for most of his releases you give a pretty negative review at least initially. either you aren’t a fan of Drake at all or you don’t like the type of music that he has evolved to either way maybe you shouldn’t review his music or you should open your mind to his past offerings. lately it’s been really cringey watching your reviews of new music seems like you have a certain comfort zone and you’re unwilling to embrace a song for what it is. anywho hope you have a great day., Fair
 kys his reviews for CLB Scorpion DLDT Views all were negative. these comments are for expression of opinion. if that bothers you then maybe you shouldn’t read the comments. anywho have a wonderful day🤍, Fair
bro get a life jesus & and im a fkn drake stan, Fair
Album age fine like wine unlike donda donda already forgettable. Clb is goated, Fair
Lmao wat. Don’t get me wrong it’s good music but WAY too repetitive. Donda is a banger. Also drake fell off with the meaning behind his music, Fair
I personally think is that people ask Drake to do something different get him to do something different then people say they want the old Drake get the old Drake and then say it's mid cause he ain't doing nothing different. jokes on themselves, Fair
Bro fountains gave me madiba riddim vibes, Fair
 , Fair
The album was aight some of the songs kinda felt random and generic. Donda was better but by any means Drakes album was decent I guess it’s just the fact that if you’ve listened to drakes older albums/songs you start to realized he could’ve done way better, Fair
CLB is really a "relative album" I mean you feel it better when you're just trying to enjoy music and feel yourself I promise you'll connect with at least one of the songs. I found that out recently also!, Fair
Idk man it seems like u guys jus tryna dig up random stuff for why everyone thinks the album is Garbo. Can’t rlly connect to drake man he’s immature and a child groomer., Fair
Bro wtf is yebbas heartbreak😧OMG, Fair
Bro I REALLY appreciate you! I was the only person around my friends saying that " Get ALong Better" sounds like musiq soulchild I spazzed when I heard you say that someone gets it!, Fair

Pobres ticos tener que jugar tan sucio para poder competir con Mexico pena ajena mijos, Fair

Hey! I have released a FINAL few tickets for my live podcast.. Hope to see you there! , Fair
In the 1990's there was the Alien Wedge - except for the steel shaft exactly the same., Fair
Wish i could go but i live in Australia lol 😜, Fair
Having reviewed the Square Strike wedge around two years ago how do you think that they compare if you remember or still have it to re-test against this wedge club?, Fair
Congratulations! Love the videos! I wish you had texted that club out of heavy rough, Fair
You should make a video about the mill grind 3, Fair
It’s clearly good for really close chips lol, Fair
Why are there any dislikes? Must be some real miserable people watching this video., Fair
Reminds me of the Alien wedge of yore, Fair
To give a bit of an idea of what this wedge sounds like........*proceeds to show off*, Fair
&*^% it! going to buy it., Fair
can u buy me my first set ], Fair
I’m still waiting on mine to come. Wow I’m at 9 weeks and sill no answer on when it’s coming and I live in the USA, Fair
Alien Wedge called from the 90's.....it wants its role back., Fair
 - The ground., Fair
3rd shot duff 🤣🤣, Fair
I dont like it...looks bad and is only good from close feels like cheating..around the green is the most creative part of golf and this takes away from that...great vid as always rick 😀, Fair
I truly feel bad for anyone that falls for these gimics ., Fair
What do bell bottoms overalls and chipper clubs all have in common? They are coming back..., Fair
i could watch him pick up balls from the green all day, Fair
I just realized that Rick Shiels and Peter Finch are not the same person not the same channel, Fair
Anyone know the music playing at , Fair
is this wedge legal?, Fair
wtf is duff chopper and hacker?? you have to explain these nuances for us idiots, Fair
I have a 42 degree 9 hybrid that is about 20 years old and it acts exactly like this new club you show here. I simply cannot fat a shot if the ball position is anywhere forward., Fair
Epic match, Fair
An amazing game, Fair
Our season was an empty promise. Quite depressing actually. I hope we get on track., Fair
It was the best game ever, Fair
Woow, Fair
This was a game of who was gonna f**k up the least., Fair
Yeah this is such a pathetic highlight video lmao. Open it with the TD play on 4th&1 then proceed to show the 20 second highlight going to commercial?? Then you only show the game winning FG in OT with no context. Sad., Fair
Great game and Kelly had the chance to put FSU away but in true Kelly fashion he keeps the other team in the game., Fair
 was he tryna griddy 😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️, Fair
I'm a FSU fan and hope the team keeps this momentum and fights hard each games., Fair
Notre dame playing so weird honestly got lucky, Fair
Haven’t seen FSU this competitive in years, Fair
change. Looking forward to the rest of the season and hopefully a new era. Go Noles!, Fair
I am so proud of #5 Joe Wilkins. I had the opportunity to take care of Joe and his sisters when he was 3 yrs. old and threw him his first football. To see what a great young man he has become through a life of adversity from birth is awe inspiring and should be a beacon of hope to everyone who doesn’t believe they are greater than their life’s circumstances. Congratulations Joe. I am truly proud of you., Fair
being there was incredible!, Fair
The coaches didn't win this game the players did for ND. I like what I saw in Florida State and you guys will have a great season. I expect ND to move on and up and the QB for Notre Dame Jack Cone is the real deal. He's got plenty of receivers running backs that can catch and a tight end Michael Mayer that will surely become a beast., Fair
Noles ..... looking real nice.. good game ND, Fair
At offensive blocking in the end zone (left side) before the pass is thrown = PI?, Fair
FSU first TD.....how many holds are they allowed???????? #52 tackled his man ! ! !, Fair
notre dame. nice., Fair
What a game., Fair
That game was disappointing. I expected FSU to get blown out., Fair
Brian kelly is an awful head coach, Fair

Biden just created the most well equipped terriost fighting force in history., Fair
Wow $billion worth of departed gift! Way to waste our tax fund. Let’s hope Biden not raise our tax for the rest of his term to compensate this loss, Fair
None are American choppers. Some are American made choppers. Theres a difference. Our inventory is not affected in this case., Fair
Wow $billion worth of departed gift! Way to waste our tax fund. Let’s hope Biden not raise our tax for the rest of his term to compensate this loss, Fair
Sad to say that the most powerful military in the world lost the war in Afghanistan to an army of cowards. I’m embarrassed right now to say I’m an American. Sorry to the Afghanistan people for abandoning you and to the rest of the world for disappointing you. The American Government has failed all of us. I can only hope that God has mercy on their souls., Fair
USA are cowards & losers, Fair
Those famous Western Values and Human Rights Concerns........After getting full security and facilitation for the departure of all Western Forces.....Kabul Airports Civilian Infrastructure was destroyed by the U.S. FORCES including Air Traffic Control Towers Runway Radars/ everything else ( without exception) so that no humanitarian Aid can arrive by Air for the 20 million Starving Afghani Victims of War.....Western Values.....Western Values and the....Western Values., Fair
of him, Fair
why are they distorting facts. The choppers are american made yes. They clearly have afghan army painting and markings! They would not take these!, Fair
The funny part is the Taliban checking out the copters left and seeing they’ve been vandalized., Fair
Regardless it is a sign of victory for them. Humiliating and defeating their enemies without using weapons and vehicles worth trillions of dollars over the last 20 years., Fair
you lost the war get over it, Fair
USA lost the war get over it. the Taliban are the world's most mighty and toughest warriors if they had the same technology as USA military they would have taken over the world they fought the tough Russian army and now the USA by the way Russia did a much better job in Afghanistan than America., Fair
If these equipments are useless but i believe talibans will make these equipments for used again, Fair
He is a HAZARA and Taliban hate Hazaras people in Afghanistan if they have a chance they will kill all Hazaras people this reporter is very braves and all Hazaras people proud of him, Fair
what is he wearing lol, Fair
Wow $billion worth of departed gift! Way to waste our tax fund. Let’s hope Biden not raise our tax for the rest of his term to compensate this loss, Fair

I'm actually starting to become a big fan of AEW. Its growing exponentially. I think Tony is make a big difference and its something the industry needed., Fair
Glad to see him happy again. Tony you won't regret it like I said a long time ago he's the only guy that can replace me (ring & promo wise). He's younger less injury's & a future world champion. Can't go wrong with Cole., Fair
Shawn Michaels Jr., Fair
That hug at the end is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen!, Fair
Let's hope aew makes enough money to keep all this up, Fair

 My Own Timestamp, Fair

Cole made the right call joining AEW. His girl and his friends are here he won't be relegated to a manager and the plethora of dream matches he can have: Jericho Danielson Moxley Christian Cage Punk Kingston MJF Guevara Omega Miro Allin Cody Black PAC Cassidy Spears Hangman just to name a few., Fair
Aew the new WCW overrated big names all hype, Fair

Beating Mercedes without using DRS. Thats how a real Champion works., Fair
Can we just consider the fact that Hamilton drove the exact same time like Max`s first flying lap in Q3?, Fair
... is that Gio in 7th?!, Fair
Cash was fouling every play but put some respect on cash’s name, Fair
Friga should’ve called more fouls but he didn’t 🤷‍♂️ people gotta stop talking shit bout cash and go beat friga in a 1v1 first, Fair
Why is this like a real Kevin hart sketch, Fair
I will bust cash for sure!, Fair
I’m super late but people really are genuinely hurt that Cash won lmao, Fair
how cash win but look worse, Fair
Lol dam elbows hacking weird ass plays cash I’m srry Buh if u do that to me we fighting idgaf and this a fan since 2k saying it’s just to a automatic reaction 😂, Fair
No respect for cash, Fair

Lmao can we seriously consider this a 1 v 1 when cabs plays like that??? 😂😂, Fair
 u smacked bruh in his eye no foul sheesh 🤣, Fair
 ur literally grabbing his arm like wtf is wrong with cash bro is he okay in the head or does he literally not know how to play ball😭, Fair
Cash once again cheating his way to a win 😂, Fair
run that back fr, Fair
Because everyone just loooves puns… at least I do, Fair
theres no such thing as a "coincidence", Fair
This is a censored version in the original morty noted “cookie isis” lmao, Fair
There's only one thing I don't understand the fact that the portal gun works with fluid. You see in other episodes you can clearly see a sphere inside the glass of the portal gun not liquid but a strange green and electric sphere, Fair
lol what that adds up the portal gun being easily chargeable, Fair
Everybody is mad at morty for messing up the formula But no one is thanking morty for literally creating the portal time lemon lime drink at Wendy's 😔, Fair
Morty bold with the portal gun. blaming Rick's mess here., Fair
Z, Fair
UNCENSORED COOKIE SCENE Came as a shock to many but w/ the power vacuum left by the heartless consumption of our dictator we shall impose even more draconian cookie law one be-cookieing at a time. BLEAUGH Oh thankyou! They took power immediately after you & your Granpa left. . Ughh sorry about that. Rick doesn't really do transition plans I-I I think he was just hungry. Well now with you here perhaps a new system of government King Morty- Sorry look I gotta run. I'm sure you guys will figure it out. I believe in you., Fair
This isnt the original version of the clip. The earlier version perfeclly captured Biden mishandling of afghanistan those anyone here have a link to the original "uncensored" clip?, Fair
When will this just be on regular Hulu not extra bullshit! Not gonna buy cable TV for a show! Am I right? Smh, Fair
WHY THE FUCKING CHANGE WITH COOKIE ISIS, Fair
Pretty slick of Morty to use the water from 2nd place to take care of the lava monster on next stop., Fair
surprised is happening given how he was at the top of the family hierarchy in the first three seasons. He was bound to fall down eventually., Fair
I just realized Cookie Freedom referenced Operation Iraqi Freedom, Fair
I'm hoping the guy in the portal in Morty's hand is Kyle Rick's old assistant alluded to by Rick's archenemy Mr. Nimbus, Fair
Morty hacked the portal gun, Fair
the dessert demension is what I would imagine if Totland became a republic overthrowing Big Mam as their queen, Fair
Morty has a hole in his hand...interesting, Fair
Who else thought the guy was Kyle at first??, Fair
so this means the portal gun is just a fancy watergun with special fluids?, Fair
Maybe tbh but in the episode both portals had to be created for the link to be made with the liquid whereas with the portal gun it immediately creates the alternate portal at the other side or in other cases other dimensions we’ve only seen the liquid interact in the same dimension when used on its own if we thought of it as the liquid creating tears in reality then the portal gun is just an aiming tool of where to connect to., Fair
I'm on Instagram: , Fair
Too easy, Fair
It's the fact that he said dealer like there is a special tank dealer, Fair
Also the Russian government thought they were mounting a tank battalion, Fair
MURICA!!, Fair
This is literally the ONLY thing I know about this movie. It's always been "that movie that bought real guns because they were cheaper than the props and had 50 tanks for a while" to me, Fair
Now we know where the taliban got their weapons from, Fair
Lucky Alec Baldwin wasn’t on that set…, Fair
All those guns are not actually Russian either. They were a Chinese model that was probably cheaper too., Fair
I actually did know that... a horrifying fact, Fair
DAMN., Fair
Wow... Cant think of anyjoke so yeah... Wow, Fair
Yea but those ak's wasn't even russian ones. Think they were Czech or something, Fair
I don't tink real guns ar supposed to be cheaper, Fair
And yet people still wonder why real guns are used instead of prop guns., Fair
Alec baldwin has entered the chat, Fair
How is that cheaper and And 1AKIs like $750, Fair
that's right i will give you the tanks but only on rent I do still need them to sell to a country and this will make it go up in value, Fair
So the basically had a real ramy for that film?, Fair
Good movie, Fair

I wish Adam Cole would have resigned with WWE he should have been the one who could have confronted with Roman reigns and debut on the main roster as a baby face. I think that wrestlers should be heels on NXT but as Babyface on the main roster, Fair

"You're not gonna believe what it is"... brother this is YouTube.. Aliens is the least surprising thing you could say, Fair
Youtube recommended one of your pond videos to me randomly last night around 3am and following this from the start was so fascinating by the time I realized I should sleep it was almost 6am haha. A lot of people have said it before me of course what an insane but wonderful project! But apart from that what keeps me hooked is that I really do love how you made the conscious decision to work with nature instead of against it by not just simply tolerating the the animals living around you guys but straight up inviting all the wildlife to your lands by planting crops specifically for them to eat. The night camera footage is always a treat! Thank you for sharing all of this with us all the best to you and your family I'm going to stop typing now and enjoy the rest of this series c:, Fair

I think your oak throne is going to float. Also may think about adding in some minnow spawning structures so you can have a self sustaining bait fish population and not have to add bait yearly., Fair
Dang bruh .. fill the pond already !, Fair
I love your video series and I glad that I found your channel but you've got to stop saying b/c of "mother nature" who does not exist. Please know that all that everything seen is from the sovereign hand of its creator God; the Lord Jesus Christ: "For by Him all things were created both in the heavens and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and for Him. Col 1 v16, Fair
This man is building a part of my dream, Fair
Power to your island...Batteries..., Fair
I'd personally put in a floating dock so as not to have to worry about water levels., Fair
you should drill a few holes in the stumps large enough for bait fish to hide and too small for large bass to get in. If would make a great fishing spot the bass would hang around trying to hit the bait fish when the come out., Fair

To people who are complaining about Mercedes's speed and they are cheating look right now how Red-Bull get this pace and this speed how is it possible? something strange !!!!!!!!, Fair
Assen would be way more exciting and actual overtaking., Fair
Super max, Fair
I love the comentator from first comment.. he makes cycling sprints intense by just speaking, Fair
Mr round the outside or round the inside has a new one. Round the banking. Annoying screaming clown., Fair
Blacked, Fair

Petition to offer 4k broadcast of F1 in the US. Its Currently only available in the UK, Fair

Describe Hamilton in one sentence-“ Is he complaining about something or what”, Fair
Port to door, Fair
I only watch highlights wherein max wins, Fair
The opening lap here is so great so much action and so much side by side and wheel to wheel this is why Zandvoort is one of the best tracks can't wait to be there again maybe next year, Fair
Versteepen is trash, Fair
What a great track, Fair
Final Results 1. Verstappen 33 2. Hamilton 44 3. Bottas 77 4. Gasly 10 5. Leclerc 16 6. Alonso 14 7. Sainz Jr 55 8. Perez 11 9. Ocon 31 10. Norris 4 11. Ricciardo 3 12. Stroll 18 13. Vettel 5 14. Giovinazzi 99 15. Kubica 88 16. Latifi 6 17. Schumacher 47 (Out) Russell 63 Tsunoda 22 Mazepin 9, Fair
Such a low life LH is.. Fastest car with entire Mercedes team behind him Teammate to block rival give a tow & let go through Team orders to abort fastest lap attempt for Bottas Unworthy undeserving driver, Fair
I bet your kids are going to be hacking this game like crazy, Fair
Just me or graphics look more cartoonish now?, Fair
Call of Duty 6...😂🤣😂, Fair
Dice ya fucked up., Fair
Kinda looks like a knock off of warzone..?, Fair
why are the skins so ugly?, Fair
Pile of bullshit., Fair
hahaha you were WAYYYYYYYYY off. this game runs horribly gunplay is laughable movement is sluggish zero recoil characters feel lame i mean i can go on and on ....wow this game is getting delayed, Fair
The original battlefields felt amazing with the no named soldiers it really helped with the immersion of being a no named soldier in the war. You didnt know the characters story and it made it feel so much like war., Fair
Where ar ethe Turkish forces?! Omg, Fair
Sentry? Barricade? That's some COD shit right there, Fair
The game looks so bright…why could they do a more similar look to bf4 would make the game look cooler but that’s just me, Fair
TAKE OFF THE BLUE HUE ON EVERYTHING AND MAKE THE GRAPPLE LIKE BF2 special forces, Fair
everyone's going off about the specialists i had a quick think and realised we dont know how they're being implemented yet. theres plenty of nameless soldiers on the specialists team - maybe specs are kinda like vehicle spawns? (im hoping), Fair
why even use anything else but the grapple looks op, Fair
If u look down at the squad we got more specialist, Fair
Guys pls hop on bf hardline on Xbox, Fair
Bruh Can't they just go back to the normal BF4 class Assault Engineer Support and Recon no bullshit specialist this ain't r6!, Fair
Better than vanguard fasho, Fair
I dont know man. I'm kinda turned off by this. :-(, Fair
I'm going to throw up because of upside down, Fair
He gave a picture of diamond ingot, Fair

Wait is your name Myles?, Fair
Lol when I like the video it shows the like icon stuff right? Well that’s the EXACT time where the video displays a “diamond ingot”, Fair
Mineclaft, Fair
Why did you put a blue ore?, Fair
Minecraft in Australia be like :, Fair
This hurts my brain, Fair

Diamond ingots need to be a thing in minecraft, Fair
Too easy, Fair
Bro i saw a grapillaying hook in your. Inventory, Fair
When u name ur world dinnerbone, Fair
Australia experience, Fair
It's so tricky, Fair
Wow A Diamond Ingot, Fair
Why did he show us iron ingot if he needs to find diaminds, Fair
It's weird when he shows the diamond is like an ingot, Fair
Oh i forgot player can upgrade or craft there grapple like a diamond grapple you can grapple around, Fair
What caused it???? Well a leaked document says the USA government wants to own the weather by 2025! Before you scoff operation popeye happened in the Vietnam war they've been tinkering with weather for a long time. As for this flood I'm sure their endeavors had some to do with it. But they would never do that....sure they wouldn't you dont know history!, Fair
The country needs to be educated on filling numbers of double-bagged garbage cans taped off and filled with all pictures important papers clothes etc. and fastened with ropes to a secure wall but all the government wants to blab about is the destruction. . . . ., Fair
Did they open any dams before this?, Fair
This land is your land and this land is my land From California to the New York island From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me As I went walking that ribbon of highway I saw above me that endless skyway Saw below me that golden valley This land was made for you and me I roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts All around me a voice was sounding This land was made for you and me When the sun come shining then I was strolling And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting This land was made for you and me This land is your land and this land is my land From California to the New York island From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me When the sun come shining then I was strolling And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling The voice come a-chanting and the fog was lifting This land was made for you and me 🎶, Fair
I've been in 2 floods on Joe St. 2019 I moved in with my sister if I hadn't my daughter and I wouldn't of made it. God bless you Mike and and all that lost loved ones and their homes..my thoughts and prayers are with you all. WAVERLY STRONG!, Fair
These days with all of this crazy weather patterns people have to prepare everyone in the home to have a backpack with at least three outfits of warm clothing and your vital records safely in plastic baggies to be ready to bolt out of there if necessary 😑 it's that serious! 😏 Sheesh, Fair
Matthews 24 thessal 5 1 peter 3 10 rev 3 the last days tornadoes earthquakes floods heatwaves the signs of the time the coming of christ., Fair
Prayers and thoughts aren’t gonna do anything.! How about these dumb ass billionaires stop sending people to space (for example) for no reason and invest in helping communities like this to prevent future floods. Fix this planet first!, Fair
Surely they don't expect people to rebuild in the flood zone. I'd move some where else no matter what the cost is., Fair
"What would you like to see to help improve the situation?" "Prayers", Fair
It's just not only people don't that underestimate the power of the water some people don't underestimate and understand the power and the wrath of mother nature., Fair
Were closing off flood lands in Mo. to build nice homes. yall deal with the waters now, Fair
Wow. I have never seen water rise that fast. Was this nearby a river? I'm trying to comprehend where in the world the water came from that quickly., Fair

Morty burrrr that's funny as heck, Fair
Blue and white and black, Fair
Fun fact some people claim that this is a hint towards a movie WHICH has been proven by Adult Swim, Fair
Oh gees Rick we’re live action, Fair
Uh morty uh we’re live action, Fair
Bune, Fair
Live action movie maybe?, Fair
First there was bttf then the adventures of doc and mharti and then rick and morty now Christopher lloyd is playing rick and lloyd played emmet brown in bttf it is a cycle, Fair
It was awesome to tease a real life Rick and Morty but unless they actually make it ESPECIALLY with Christopger Lloydd it will be disappointing., Fair
Doc brown is the guy we need as rick, Fair
It's in season 5 it could a episode Rick make a reality change with the portal gun so they go any universe Bec Rick said Morty what happened definitely the machine will break and they will in real life or this could be a anthor show, Fair
I CANT WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT!, Fair

What’s your time lapse music called?, Fair
Your The best Pearl, Fair
How about you make a kraken or a sea dragon, Fair
What's your timelapse music called?, Fair
Hello pearl I love your videos and can you try to make some shorter videos for once just a trial because then you can crank out more videos and more people will watch them because it kinda feels intimidating seeing a 40 min video on your home page but I will watch all of your videos pearl whatever size they may be of I'm hermitcraft gang I support all hermits and want to become one at some point but I know tht wont happen., Fair
I swear pearl has the best montage music of all the boatem members! Maybe even all of hermitcraft dare I say!, Fair
How pearl built its base reminds me of an art technique called grayscale where first you work on the volume and then you add colors and it is very helpful for compositions! I need to test this on some building Also I new in your channel and I SO in love I'm catching up on the hermicraft series from the start!! 💕💕✨, Fair
Story of the boatem city: It was once a peacful Island with 5 Friends 1 named Pearl who had a lighthouse castle but then the water drained and more people came and boots came on land and now the 5 Friends still remember this and only has the boatem pole and boatem Hole as remembering of the ocean 🧝🏻‍♀️🚢🗼❤️, Fair
I think you might have been grian He's a trickster And cause it almost said hes name, Fair
that lotus flower design is really cool imma steal it for something, Fair
There ain't no mountain high enough., Fair
So in Austrailian a Swag Bag is a stick and bindle?, Fair
oh an arg hm, Fair
I think Grian just likes to try to put Mumbo in charge when Mumbo himself isn't there to object., Fair
Yhe rest of the server can just tell when everyone of boatem ia dying there having a meeting, Fair
It looks a little weird because it’s undetailed but other than that I think it looks really cool!, Fair
Pearl quick question. Are you Australian?, Fair
Pearl you bring me luck I just got told that I might get a cat in December!!!!, Fair
The phantom actually looks a bit like a ballista., Fair
Your episodes are very entertaining. Thank you!, Fair
wasn't hermatrix a game made by doc?, Fair
I actually love builds with snow on it! No need to remove it for us unless it just bugs you personally. Also your castle is soooo cool even just in stone. I love it! You have a great build style., Fair
Interesting! In America “swag” means a goody bag or prizes of some kind that you are given because of attending an event., Fair

this honestly made me very sad because this man has made me laugh for a long time and to be honest i cried., Fair
i’ve always wanted to just show schlatt good solid friendship because sometimes i get the feeling he needs somebody to be soft to him. wishing you nothing but the best!!, Fair
Glad he got somewhat over this, Fair

NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Come on guys don't deny it. is literally Connor in scarecrow form. Sorry for the delay in this episode! Both Connor and I have have been moving around these last few weeks (Connor and apartment me a studio). We've got lots of adventures planned with the next one appearing on his channel CDawgVA later in the month. WHERE do you guys want to see us go next?!, Fair
Oh boy, Fair
Long time subscriber here. Hey I know Connor is a complete pain in the ass. But the chemistry you two have is absolutely amazing. There's a reason every sitcom from the Honeymooners on worked so well. It's like you got your own free Barney Rubble., Fair
Strip clubs!!!, Fair
Little Sweden!, Fair
Please do the Spanishtown you referenced in the Netherlands episode. It would be cool to see!, Fair
I have decided if I make it to Japan I want to take a trip with you guys, Fair
it's a blood stain... period. hehe, Fair
I had a chance to go see a relative that was suppose to be working over there. Pandemic delayed. Oh I’m on now. Scarecrows, Fair
Laughing my ass off I’ve been on a few similar. Oh hell no ..., Fair
All that blood everywhere it's highly possible that people have been shooting up/injecting drugs. They always tap the syringe then push out the air and or fluid sometimes it's mixed with their blood from missing the vein. On the other hand some of that is likely to be OTHER bodily fluids... GET OUT THAT PLACE IS A DEATH/STD TRAP!, Fair
never seen 2 girls be so scared of a bridge just walk across the damn thing quit telling us how scary it is, Fair
They r not proper british explorers oi mate lets colonise, Fair
Hotel hell in Japan., Fair
You don't have to find any excuse just be straight up the place is nasty and disgusting and u want your money back, Fair
Bro I have the weirdest crush on Chris, Fair
Imagine there being a horrible storm and you take shelter in a random building and this is what you're stuck with: , Fair
That receptionist thought you both banged for 2 hours and left., Fair
This would be a 4 star hotel somewhere in India or Pakistan or Russia, Fair
When he said "It's the cheapest" and Connor basically mouthed the same thing... (YouTube) Friends Moments Be Like!, Fair
The intro was one small chord away from being Persona 4 Specialist, Fair
Ever seen that movie Sorcerer? Just be thankful you were carrying a camera not nitroglycerin, Fair
That hotel has to be kept like that for the memes. They can't be for real., Fair
 fun fact James May has his own scarecrow doll in there somewhere lol form his our man in Japan show would have been funny if you saw it, Fair
Doesn't Joey ride by this in the Trash Taste : Cycling Across Japan special?, Fair
Honestly I think Spike "Geronimo" Tyson would be a great name., Fair
I agree with you, Fair
Now that is quick thinking, Fair

Until today I laughed at and mercilessly judged those giant nerd losers who cry at pop culture reveal videos. Today I join those giant nerd losers. Fight me., Fair
This may be unpopular to say but I am dreading this show. Just from the previews I have seen there are so many things that make the book purist in me twitch but I have seen glimpses that if what I saw is what they are doing.....why?!? There are massive popular fantasy books out there with tons of details on environment and characters. Do not just "base" the movie or show off of these books USE the book as the basis for the script!, Fair
Fab series 😍😍 Waiting for 4th ep, Fair
I was looking forward to this but they ruined it with diversity. Thanks for nothing Amazon., Fair
Ugh what's with the casting? If they didn't even get that right I shudder to think what they did with the rest of it. Likely nothing more than exaggerated special effects and pushing of political agendas. Another franchise butchered by modern television standards..., Fair
Why it has the infinity war bgm?, Fair
I read up to only book 7? Forget but it was amazing! I really hope the tv-series adaptation is just as amazing! :], Fair
It's not. The material is so anti-cannon that it would have been better to call it something else., Fair
They completely ruined the whole story., Fair
as a non-book reader i actually enjoyed (a lot) the first 3 episodes. will keep watching this series., Fair
The picture quality looks better here than it does on Amazon prime ! The quality is Terrible on amazon., Fair
Diversity.. Hoooray!!, Fair
Holy crap this is just bad. Wooden acting aplenty. No real meaning to a lot of scenes. I had no idea what was going on in the first episode. They fought a herd of wandering chewbacca’s is all I know. They lit some floating candles and a chick fell in the river. I think that covers it., Fair
Whats the music?, Fair
How many times did you watch this trailer? Me: YES, Fair
7/10, Fair
man can use magic? why only woman, Fair
FFS it will be explained in the show....., Fair
It's awful rubbish. Just watched the first episode whatever you picture as bad it's so much worse than that., Fair
Which should make you very happy., Fair
The best thing about lockdown was webseries, Fair

Luigi stole mario's wife forever and now mario is high on drugs, Fair
A Ouija one, Fair
I hate Luigi 😤😤😤, Fair
When he said your peach was in my castle he moved his eyebrows intently, Fair
VerbalAse should do: Wario Vs. Waluigi Princess Peach Vs. Princess Daisy , Fair
Mario and Luigi won peach is stupid, Fair
Amazing 👏, Fair
I love how this one is not one sided. It shows how both the brothers are truly equal., Fair
So anyone gonna talk bout how Marios and Luigis character are the same, Fair
I gotta thank this guy for completing my childhood with the beatbox battle series Finally I came back after 2016, Fair

I'm so emotional this morning realizing just how far we've come and how much hard work has gone into making this rundown 70s cabin our dream home. Thank you all for coming on this journey with us. What an adventure 🔨🚧🏡 ... what's your favourite space?!?!, Fair
Hi Eamon & Bec really loving your channel so much 😍 Is your cabin on Airbnb? If so can u provide a link please Thanks Love you 😍, Fair
My Alexa responded to you saying "I am feeling excited because it is the week of Halloween 🎃! Maybe they should call it "HalloweeK" Bazzingah!", Fair
what happened to your guys dog?, Fair
"The Kitchen" !! and if you'd kindly give me your address(I want tell anyone else) I will throw my clothes in ah bag and be there by weeks end wearing ah smile to house sit while you two playboys travel the world. Sound like ah good deal I'm ready when you are !! 👍, Fair
The kitchen is my favorite I just love it., Fair
You guys did such a great job! The home is beautiful! Was it hard to leave the cabin and go back to full time van life?? What happens to the home now that you are back in Morocco??, Fair
1) How rich you could be to impulse buy two jetskis?!?? 2) If you decide to sell that cabin I would like to buy it., Fair
You guys should rent this out! I would totally go stay there with my family and friends! Love y’all!, Fair
Love transformation of the cabin😍, Fair
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🎯, Fair
👍👍, Fair
Boy you guys really did a lot. Looks great and fun., Fair
You did such an incredible job. It’s beautiful guys. And that location! The waterfront! Wow just wow. I’m about an hour north of Toronto and we have been looking at small places In Muskoka. This gives me such inspiration. I know it’s silly to feel proud for people you don’t actually know but I feel so proud of you guys. Much love🇨🇦, Fair
I love your videos. The cabin is absolutely beautiful. I'm from Ontario but live in England now. I'm curious what part of Ontario is the cabin in? Is this Georgin Bay? The landscape is gorgeous. Thanks for sharing the remodel - you've done a great job!!, Fair

Hello Crusoe:D, Fair
My favorite part was the whole episode, Fair
why did the dog dodo on the rood., Fair
I want to see their new concert so badly!, Fair
Had the good fortune of growing up in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Grew up listening to ABBA., Fair
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY - THEY ARE BACK. ABBA IS BACK!! <3 <3 I smiled & teared up the second it started literally ugly-sobbed my way through watching this video (with a huge grin simultaneously). I'm still crying. I didn't expect it. I grew up on ABBA I love ABBA i am a die-hard ABBA fan & will always stan them. Now I didn't know about this. Last I heard was when they planned to get together for like 2 songs a few years back. And then it seemed like it had fallen through. I'm scrolling the 'google news' on my cell while a anime episode loads on my laptop & one of the articles was "ABBA's new 2021 album reviewed" or something like that. Me: "....................... I'm sorry. WHAT!?" Immediately opened Youtube on my laptop and this video was the top result. AND FOR ALL THE TROUBLE THE WORLD IS DEALING WITH LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL AND GLORIOUS. BECAUSE ABBA. And also can I just say - they kept their legendary music style!! They didn't try to do rap or dubstep - they were themselves. They were ABBA. And we can all agree - this song is the definition of music. And everything about it. This song. , Fair
One of my favourite groups ever indeed! I ve learnt English thank to them . Greetins from Argentina two any Swedish person who could read my comment., Fair
Fantastic 👏, Fair
So you see a bird dancing as the music notes go up and down? They could move their wings up and down as well. Flutter away with a butterfly!!, Fair
ABBA - I love you and "THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC". 😀😍♥️👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋, Fair
Toller Song - warum muss man sich aber hinter Avantaren verstecken? Alle sind doch in Würde gealtert., Fair
Tak til Abba ❤️ jeg elsker jer ♥️ nok nærtliggende at vi i Danmark elsker Abba ♥️ jeg vi l gerne sige tk dor Jeres sngw de bwryser så meget og alt for mig❤️🇩🇰🥂, Fair
Jeg korrigere 🤗tak til Abba ❤️ jeg elsker jer ♥️, Fair
3 more albums please!!!😀, Fair
 Skyler Borg He meant 300, Fair
Curious...why 3?, Fair
Nostalgia ain't what it used to be. A little confusing as to whether they're back together or not? Now is the only time there is. Don't get me wrong. Stunningly beautiful song stunningly well sung. Let's keep it contemporary. Love them the way they are now more than the way they were then., Fair
I know that "Little Things" festive video will be out Dec 3. But all of these other great new songs need videos like this at least to enhance the experience!..., Fair
can't stop listening!, Fair
The new album is wonderful. Don't listen to any of this negative garbage. It's so much fun. It's such a gift to have new ABBA after all of these years. People will literally complain about anything and everything these days. Miserable people can't wait to spread their misery around., Fair
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍..., Fair
I wasn’t expecting to be so emotional listening to this - thank you ABBA 🙏🏻, Fair
The best song! For me that is., Fair
all the songs are beautiful and masterpieces, Fair
Another reason why this album and band are just so damn good!!!, Fair
 Attila Balogh soooooo many good ones to decide! I love all of the eclectic choices. My favourites change like with all of their albums., Fair
Ode to freedom is the best for me., Fair
Angels of golden music came back to Enthral the world 🌎 💛 ✨ 💖, Fair

Omg Khaby Lame, Fair
Sunny has crush on a character in a game like bruh she doesn’t exist 😑, Fair
Am I the only one who realised that Mr Dan wrote "1+1=11" 🤪✨, Fair
When your old school’s pe teacher was also your computer teacher: Ahh the memories.., Fair
Adventure rank 7 and every character??, Fair
Sunny was already my fav character but he plays GENSHIN??? +100 points 😨, Fair

Season 4 at last Christmas has come early this year. The wife and I love watching Yellowstone., Fair
I slowed it down and why is rip beating loyd up🤯, Fair
I'm woke and I love it, Fair
I've never watched this before I'm thinking about watching, Fair
Finaly💯👌, Fair
Commercial: "You don't want to miss the new season of Yellowstone." Me: "Yes I do", Fair
The opening scene was freaking incredible!!! Well except for Casey’s anorexic wife running with a rifle that weighs more than she does. Could they not find a single actress that knows how to eat in Hollywood? 🙄, Fair
Why is Rip Hitting Loyd?? I know I ain't the only one that seen that., Fair
Why haven’t I heard about this series? Seems the media buries content that doesn’t fit the woke narrative., Fair
Is this as melodramatic as it looks or is groundedly good?, Fair
They got it right on this one. Amazing series, Fair
How did I miss this? Just found my friend watching S4 EP 1 and holyshiiiii Kacey just chilling in his office and everything goes braaattatatatatata he hides and then he suits up drives kaboom hits the van and braaattatatatatata Wadaheo! 🤯🤯🤯 I have to go back to season 1 and get to watch it for the first time how cool is that?, Fair
THE BECK BROTHER THE BLUE EYED SILVER HEADED SOB WHO WORE A WHITE COWBOY HAT LEFT FOR DEAD BY JOHN DUTTON IN A FIELD FOR KIDNAPPING HIS GRANDSON. HE'S THE ONE BEHIND THE ATTACKS WHO SET UP THE ATTACKS. MY MONEY SAYS HE DID NOT D I E BUT RECOVERED TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A SCENE OF A WHITE COWBOY HAT FLOATING DOWN A CREEK FROM AN ABOVE SHOT. JUST A GUESS., Fair
Love this show, Fair
If something bad happens to Lloyd I’m gonna be so upset. He’s my favorite lol. It looked like Rip punching him!, Fair
You'd think everyone in Montana is skinny and good looking after watching this series. As a former resident of Montana I want accuracy. 85% of the characters should be morbidly obese., Fair
Are you insolating the hull, Fair
We as viewers are hooked construction finition and after voyage, Fair
Great Vid. In the Galley please consider a "pull-out" counter section to enable the wraparound. One is nice two would be awesome. The extra counter space is amazing. (FYI I've watched ALL the Tally vids..... I'm behind and late in catching up... BUT DAMN. fun doing so). Thanks, Fair
whoa! that dude has a ring in his nose, Fair
Keep up the great builds Best of luck on completion God bless you and the crew Glen from guam usa, Fair
Second time around 3.40 seconds priceless, Fair
I'm not a swimmer nor love water but the boat looks very safe I'd really love to practice on it🥺 really., Fair
Who am I describing Goku and Denis Rodman ? Lol these folks are great :), Fair
For my Jason 35 cutter Jenna Simone I’m planning to raise my settee floor about 7 or 8 inches both for a bit more amidships bench seat length and for a some storage underfoot when seated at the settee table. Might think about that for Tally Ho., Fair
what a nice job, Fair
The inventory of it just keeps on getting interesting., Fair
A jewel .... extraordinary this replica .... guys. greetings from Chile. Una Joya....extraordinaria esta replica....muchachos. saludos desde Chile., Fair
Hopefully no one snores sleeping in the Folksl., Fair
I have more of a technical question. How is true level for interior floors determined while the boat is out of water? Isnt it possible that the sheer line of the hull ( what you would theoretically use as your level) can change based on the weight and distribution of weight inside? Just an aside comment: I am a wood worker of 45+ years and have found even a cheap laser level an indispensable tool over conventional stick levels especially traversing over multiple points and direction., Fair
I still think an engine that runs on alcohol is best for a marine application. In case of a fuel spill and fire water will put it out quite easily. Not only that but you can have a still and make your own fuel... ...and Rum. lol, Fair
Enjoying the series and its spectacular making of the boat all time home family favorite., Fair
Man! Is that Nina the cutest thing you have ever seen or what? 😍, Fair

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9) Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind Nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-10), Fair
I hope you reached 5 mil so you are stuck in an everlasting cycle No hate tho, Fair
Please read this carefully ; Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied we’ve stolen we’ve sinned sexually and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars thieves fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions . The problem is we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice meaning he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago he left his throne in heaven and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here he lived a perfectly righteous life only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . Right before he died he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it but rather as a free gift of grace .. Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . Do this and you will be saved . If you do so sincerely God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife . You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make . Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ; ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die but after this THE JUDGMENT’., Fair

Przepiękny utwór duże brawa!!!, Fair
Totally agree., Fair
Recognisably ABBA-esque. Love the bounce. Song to dust down one's John Travolta white disco suit from the 80's. If one can still shoehorn oneself into it? Now there's a New Year's resolution., Fair

HOLY BIBLE--- 3 But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them., Fair

Looking back on this game it’s a wonder Clemson scored 3 poinrs, Fair
Would think this was a boring game but the dawgs defense was to fun to watch, Fair
A Game that made me glued to my house..so great and eñtertaining, Fair
I really love the game it's Soo exciting, Fair
Alabama defense armed to the tooth👍, Fair
There was strong defence in both side but I can without any doubt say that Georgia is quite good in it's defence..., Fair
Enjoyed that game!!, Fair
Good game, Fair
AMERICAN FOOTBALL, Fair
🐗, Fair
 INTERSTATE20GA aye it’s alright we still gonna go 10-2 or better, Fair
Lmaooooooo, Fair
Either the defense for both teams are OP or both the QBs are just cheeks. Great old school style game though. Don’t see too many like this anymore., Fair
It's the first thing, Fair
1st of all dabo Swinney is over paid. He had deshawn Watson only reason he beat bama. Georgia will crush them Gators when they play!, Fair
Seems like Georgia may be Bamas Kryptonite 👀, Fair
this Clemson Bulldogs vs Georgia Tigers game was quite the defensive bidding. I don’t see either of these teams making the chip this year., Fair
GA Defense - 7 GA Offense - 3, Fair
how many sacs was that?, Fair
fake subs are more in this channel, Fair
I mean Clemson had receivers running the same routes together like what? Also RB couldnt block in the backfield even if he noticed it coming. Then DJ was just confused. Looked scared to play ball. Overall a terrible performance by just about everyone on offensive side of the ball except some of the experienced receivers like Ngata and Ross. Just looked like a HS team playing., Fair
Good match, Fair

“I ran out of bullets in my MP5” finishes downed person with MP5 , Fair

It doesn't deserve a follow, Fair
“No ammo in my mp5” finishes the kill with the mp5 , Fair

After wasting the entire 1st half cj stroud came out in rain in a foreign stadium and just played lights out....almost breaking records for total yards for 1st start...idk what y'all smoking but....Ohio state going be lights out on offense...and yes defense needs play better and we will see they will beat Oregon by double digits regardless but if they wanna win playoff games the defense has to be better, Fair
Minnesota played like IU played last year. they might have a good year, Fair

HOLD UPPP WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUK WAS THAT PLOT TWISTT😭, Fair
Hi, Fair
BOY THIS IS SCARIER THAT SQUID GAME, Fair
During the Axe Fight and the gun standoff for the axe fight if you actually blink a few times breathe in and exhale in a focusing way you can actually see in the dark. With the Gun Standoff I saw two members of the staff. Before I'd grab the gun I'd tell my girl to aim at the staff last second and kill them both. Run and get their machine guns and start shooting others down. Of course won't be easy but it's better to just take a few down with you. If by some miracle you survive the shootout then you could probably find secret doors they kept and just look around., Fair
They need help, Fair
the creators of this movie obviously watched too much big brother and it shows in the stupidity of the writing, Fair
 Cinema summary going detailed how to survived the axe battle Me a intellectual: spins , Fair
That is true 7 items can be stored in a humans brain because I played survive and kill the killers in Area 51 and there is one code that’s a 7 digit and I remember it it’s 56647, Fair
Looking squid game, Fair
Why would I leave it funhouse, Fair
If that pinata is actually in the movie. She would see the it is high up. Then if she swung the bat she would be hitting it lower. This woman has no brain cells, Fair
Yoooooo more deadly squid game (LEAKED NO CLICKBAIL :OOOOOOO), Fair
Who do you think will perform best in 2022 with the new regulation changes? Top comment wins a surprise gift! Subscribe to my channel for the next F1 preview: , Fair
Sebastian Vettel all the way!, Fair
As a team I'm interested to see what Aston Martin can make of the changes. As a driver I think Norris will thrive and the obvious answer George Russell, Fair

You need to make ones for Austin and Mexico!! I’m struggling so much in the S’s of Austin., Fair
I think Norris will perform best he seems to be outperforming the car now and with changes I imagine this would improve the car. Norris will likely outperform this as well and be the best. However Russell might do well in the Merc. But I'm going with Norris., Fair
Does somebody know which steering wheel hes using?, Fair
I kinda liked the hot lap with no sound ha, Fair
what game is this, Fair
Fh4, Fair
It will be decided between Russell and Max !!, Fair
Hey mister! You have to analize what happened in Sochi please! Considering just the result looks like an average race but boy! you couldn't be more wrong xD, Fair

I honestly am convinced the previous owners got word that shane and Ryland were a gay (I know Shane’s bi) couple and switched it up on purpose at least that’s what I got from out of anyone who could have bought it 😂, Fair
Okay... but how are the previous owners how I imagine Shane and Ryland in the future? Plus Shane made that comment about ‘this is how I would have designed it’ and ‘did i own this house?’ So many fun little lovely coincidences!, Fair
ugh i’m crying… the happiness in this video… all the emotions. i’m so happy for you guys! i’ve been watching shane since i was literally 12. you deserve this ♥️, Fair
I'm surprised yo didnt get a better house than this ..., Fair
Never give up Christ! Shane and Ryland deserve this never give up your dreams!, Fair

Los Salvas le tienen miedo al los americanos! Trátenlos igual q Mexico cabrones!, Fair
 ... (7), Fair
USA come back good usa, Fair
What a yawn inducing lackluster performance by both teams., Fair
Decent video but hint to editor: a substitution is not a highlight., Fair
Well surprisingly fantastic! 4-1 in their own turf? it's just amazing!!. Going into the second half one goal down I was trying to control myself but when it was 1-1 and the way they were playing I knew something good was coming. Pulicic again a disappointment. Embarrassingly he completely missed a heather there was only one play that contributed to a goal then he left the pitch limping. Good luck on his come back to Chelsea ... their German coach must be closely watching him., Fair
So proud of the Salvadoran team ! Love both teams ! Half of my heart is 💙 and the other half is ♥️, Fair
 dsf let me be proud what is your pique ? What you got to be disrespectful? Let me remind you we are commenting about sports not food . I believe your a man I’m a woman so let me feel how I want !!!, Fair

Malisimo El Salvador!, Fair
My mom is from the US and my dad is from El Salvador so i root for both teams! Id absolutley love to see both sides of my culture make it into the WC. Espsecially EL SALVADOR, Fair
simple. Until our best athletes play soccer we aren't going to dominate. Love Pulisic but what is he 155 pounds? All the best athletes are in the south and California and they play football basketball and a few baseball. If the US ever did have even 1/4th of our best athletes play we would dominate the world. Imagine all the defensive backs and linebackers in football switching to soccer at age 10. Until that happens we are going to struggle to beat teams like Canada., Fair
US soccer sucks now….. they going down like hell, Fair
4 - 1, Fair
Weak game these teams only but a better foot forward when playing Mexico it’s a damm shame that’s what makes them better.. boring game...🤨, Fair
Don't let the media fool you USNMT fans. Getting a draw at El Salvador is a good result!, Fair
Can't beat a fukken 3rd world country....sad., Fair
Being 3rd world doesn’t have a lot to do with their soccer team., Fair

Lol image bothering to help someone when statistically speaking they're unlikely to help you in the same situation. Let them get what they deserve., Fair
The problem with people not believing in climate change is not because the data is not visceral. It's because the narrative is overblown and it actually doesn't line up with the objective data. People can smell out b.s. a mile away and because of that people don't know where the b.s. and truth line is drawn. So why believe any of it? For crying out loud for 100 years people have been saying that the world is going to end it 10 years., Fair
I love Veritasium but let me understand this video. Sure: anecdotal stories are popular and spreading quick and communicate better. Scientific methods and conclusion hardly can gain that kind of popularity. Let me rephrase this statement with a different metaphor: for an average human being reading Cinderella is much easier and more entertaining than reading even a one page publication from Bohr about spinning electrons. The majority of humans are neither have the brain capacity to deal with Bohr nor the interest or just they are trying to pay their mortgages or survive. It is not a big surprise that easy to understand populist stories trumps over dry data. Same applies to music. It is easier to listen a pop (popular) music then really pay attention to Rachmaninoff. So to the question: why anecdotes trump data? Because one is easy and interesting the other is boring and tedious? Does it mean that an easy read brings more value to society? Soap operas are easy to watch and sadly it is extremely popular. It is not hard to watch 8 seasons of an entertaining show and people do that instead of spending fraction of that time with any mental work (just thinking about another Veritasium video about "Gun" and "Drew"). Yes sometimes anecdotes trump data but it is bad. Why scientific results need to go through on a populist pass? Was any populist voting about how to build a mobile phone launch a rocket build a building or anything? No. Because the majority has and should not have word on it. Because they do not know. It is not their job. For many serious breakthrough results we should do our best to either: avoid the need for a populist pass or create an entertaining story which explains it to a 5 years old. My last metaphor: anecdotes are equivalent to a one page marketing material of a product. Data is the backend. One is not competing with the other but support each other. The user can only read a one pager marketing brochure and make a buying decision and use the product. The backend or engineering will make it useful or not. So my conclusion: we cannot compare anecdotes with data. We need both for success (just because of the consumerism but that is a separate big topic why the hack we even need anecdotes for things should be supported only by data)., Fair
100 agree...it is an entertainment media not an informational one. I think your point of the documentarian trying to "FOCUS" the viewer on the subject of the documentary., Fair
I also probably wouldn't have helped. Because I don't care., Fair

This is why so many people believe the Covid vaccines have deleterious side effects. They are being swayed by personalized anecdotes claiming causation and ignoring data that shows no causation., Fair
 Nathan A unfortunately even data like that can be gamed because as the percentage of the population that is vaccinated approaches 100% so does the ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated in hospitals. So for example people point to Israel (where there are very high vaccination rates) and say that the fact that most people who are hospitalized are vaccinated is evidence that the vaccines are making people sick., Fair
4/5 current hospitalized Covid patients are unvaccinated. It’s so clear that the vaccine works to help keep people from getting sick but the stories of nefarious activity is more convincing to people., Fair
fake science paid for by big business. thanks for coming out of the closet. and here I thought you were one of the good ones. I think this kind of thing is why people think you can drink clorox as a covid treatment. Monsanto pays scientists to lie all the time. So there you have it., Fair

I definitely heard of Robert Wadlow and poor young man he'd died very young at 22 years old. I'm so happy I'm not that tall because I sometimes tend to have pain in my body simply because of my height. I'm 6'4 188-192 lbs at 19 years old and I'm still kind of growing but very slowly. Ever since I was little I always wanted to be tall because I was always a small fry like very short., Clickbait

I believe giants like the ones shown in ancient history still exist today in the world (bigger than dude in the vid) and are being hidden by the same ones who re wrote our history to say some manipulative controlling shit like Christopher Columbus discovered america and that’s the land we live on today. Anyway giants definitely are a part of our ancestry I strongly feel and most of what is known as mythology or legends actually hold more truth than we are led to believe, Clickbait
At some point in prehistory large size humans was the norm. Can you imagine their houses., Clickbait
 The giant here is not fully human. He is a product of cross-breeding with the Nephilim. The Nephilim are a crossbreed between humans and Angels., Clickbait

No one wants to say the real reason because when you call these employers out on their behaviour they're quick to shy away from it and shift it back at you or play dumb such as "Oh no one want's to work and we don't know why." They're narcissists on the jobs and they only speak in two ways: interrogative and accusatory statements. When you're first hired they don't just ask personal questions but they will later accuse you for something they did. First comes the personal questions when you meet them and work with them and later down the road when you defeat their fraud they will turn to accusations against you. Dealing with a narcissist is like being arrested. They're very crabby people in every sense of the word you could call them a cancer. Also when coworkers start acting different towards you out of the blue it means the narcissist managers/supervisors already turned them against you easily with their lies. I've seen it in schools in jobs and in the neighborhoods they get people to shun you and isolate you. There is an epidemic of narcissism in society. There is no keeping peace with a narcissist they live to create chaos and discourse. These are all the reasons why narcissists are dangerous and by extent a massive reason why people are refusing to re-enter the workforce today. Nobody want's to say it's narcissism and fraud too because it's the pink elephant in the room., Clickbait
I am in this industry and it's because you have to work so many hours and there are so many hours and your life isn't your own almost, Clickbait
from leaving universities to leaving giant tech companies we grew up but the legacy remains 🩸, Clickbait
They give you perks that you cannot enjoy. I was given choice to reimburse $1000 vacation money but director of engineering was not giving me vacation... They setup game zone but if you are in high demanding project...you cannot getup for restroom ( not exaggerating ) They give subsidize food but if you eat it you may get sick because all you do is sit all day through...so the best is you prepare salad at home lol... For me group outings are forced..I don't want to spend more time with team members... I got the chance to join leadership meet-up in a resort..all day we were sitting in lecture hall in the evening we were forced to hear MD singing... ... You get the picture..., Clickbait
So bottom line if you are not a software developer you are screwed., Clickbait
Spoiled brats are what they are lol, Clickbait
Tech is exhausting. I burnt out after five years and I'm just running on fumes. I like a lot about tech and study it for fun but working for companies under pressure takes the soul out of everything., Clickbait
one of the biggest causes being the realization that there IS NO "Job Security., Clickbait

 The first step to successful investing is figuring out your goals and risk tolerance - either on your own or with the help of a Financial Advisor. If you can get the facts about savings and investing with a well detailed plan you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your income., Clickbait
Contrary to conventional wisdom you don't need to have a hefty trust fund or ultra deep pockets like mutual funds to start investing. I initially invested $8k Canadian I was making Return of investment at the end of the week and reinvested as my profits began compounding rapidly, Clickbait

That Wanted Person prank. You gotta be real careful with pranks like that. They can be fun one on one but when it's blended into reality and gets a lot of people involved it can cause issues for those with mental disorders. Even if they're not the victim., Clickbait

The elevator floor prank imagery MUST be altered from what the occupants actually saw. Each hidden camera angle shows a different perspective of the shaft underneath the elevator from that high offset camera angle. That's impossible. If meant to convince the occupant then it would be from their perspective and when viewed from the offset camera the image would be the same from every camera just skewed., Clickbait
And then they found out she was actually a criminal and that’s why she was so stressed, Clickbait
hope everyone knows that the 1st video was 100% fake and staged., Clickbait

Somehow it's sad but on the other hand it's fkn hilarious what people come up with. If it's in high paid sports it's somewhat gangster considering all the existing shadyness around it. But just to be on the podium as an ironman where it comes all down to your training endurance and will is like the lamest thing I can imagine. That woman took part and already beats 99 9% of the population but still has the ego to corrupt this raw competition that's just sad. Not stating they are all clean but you get the point., Clickbait

Donald Duck Lips don't even look good on a duck. Why do women keep paying big money for them? And most of these actors really would have been better off just leaving their face alone and instead focused on eating healthy and staying away from the damaging sun. If you have an obvious issue that you would like to change. It should only take one surgery and you are done. These people get addicted to surgery., Clickbait

when you look at TheRichest personals and owners you see that they were actual people before being related to this piece of shit misinterpreted as a wanna-be-magazine but now they are just monsters more horrible and disfigured than any actor alive or in this video but just for the inside., Clickbait

Don’t care. Didn’t ask., Clickbait
NO RESPECT!! THIS CHANNEL IS SO NEGATIVE AND I WOULD NEVER ENDORSE AND I WILL PASS THIS ALONG!!! AGING ACTORS ARE NOT MONSTERS GO BACK TO SCHOOL, Clickbait

Jon Gosselin couldn't have been too "rich" to begin with if he had to get jobs at TGI Fridays and as a DJ to pay his bills...  I suppose I could say that about the entire premise of this video now that I think about it--the vid doesn't say how "rich" these people actually were (10 "Richest" People) to begin with.  I would think it would take more than starring in a mediocre reality TV show to become "rich"; and/or that it would take more than the cancellation of a TV show for a "rich" person to be forced to work menial jobs., Clickbait
